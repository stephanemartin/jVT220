# jVT220 - Java VT220 terminal emulator

This repository is forked from [jvt220](https://github.com/jawi/jVT220).
One of the most important changes in this forked version, is the addition of a [TerminalClient](/src/main/java/nl/lxtreme/jvt220/terminal/TerminalClient.java)  class, which allows to actually connect to a VT-type mainframe application, and then using this well modularized project to parse the received information from [TelnetClient](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/) socket. 

For more information about the original project please visit the documentation [here](https://github.com/jawi/jVT220/blob/master/README.md)
